Aurora in Motion Everywhere Plus
v1
======================

This mod tweaks laulajatars Aurora in Motion Everywhere to randomly show the two color variations of Northern Lights. While you had to decide for the purple or the green & pink version before, this mod gives both a chance of 50 % to appear.

I only altered laulajatars script as per permission given on the mods Nexus page.

Originally this was based on Elbethiens Realistic Aurora in Motion, who has kindly given permission for modders to use her beautiful models and textures.
